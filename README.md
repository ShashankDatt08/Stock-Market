This project implements a Stock Exchange Order Matching System in Java, designed to process buy and sell orders efficiently using a linked list-based order book. It uses multi-threading for simulating transactions and atomic operations for safe concurrent updates.

Features:
1.Supports Buy and Sell orders with price and quantity matching.
2.Implements an Order Book that maintains separate buy and sell queues.
3.Uses atomic references to ensure thread-safe operations.
4.Matches orders based on price-time priority.
5.Supports multi-threaded order placement and matching.
6.Implements an event-driven matching engine to execute trades automatically.
